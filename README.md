## Welcome to My GitHub!

My name is Shunji Wan, an incoming MS in Data Science student [__*@ Columbia Engineering*__](https://datascience.columbia.edu/education/programs/m-s-in-data-science/) !

In my junior year at [__*@ Vassar College*__](https://www.vassar.edu/math) , I switched my major from _PoliSci_ to _Stats_ out of curiousity about the world of data. Through this journey of statistical science, I've acquired and applied skills to solving real-life problems. This GitHub account serves as showcase for some of my projects - as well as a workshop for people to brainstorm!

As a data enthusiast, I look forward to exchanging ideas and making progressive impacts to the communities. Please feel free to visit my repositories if you're interested, and always open for connections and suggestions about project ideas or collaboration!
